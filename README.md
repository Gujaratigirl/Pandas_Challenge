  Please use file - 2 HeroesOfPymoli_starter.ipynb

## Progress

All assignments are complete


I do have a warning/error on Purchase Analysis Gender
The code did return the results that I needed but with the warning.

## Formatting
Several places have a rounding error when the last digit is a '0'.
  I tried several ways to add in the '0' but wasn't successful for all of the tables.  
  Purchase Analysis Age- the commas didn't work.  I tried several ways but coudln't get both the $ and , together
